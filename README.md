# DigiClicker
A game about scanning Digimon, defeating tamers, and watching numbers get bigger.

NOTE: DigiClicker is still in development!

You can try out the current state at https://www.google.com/

You can reach out on discord to discuss your ideas and how to implement them: No Discord link.

# Developer instructions

## Editor/IDE setup

We have an [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) and linting configured, to help everyone write similar code. You will find our recommended plugins for VSCode below, however you should be able to find a plugin for other IDEs as well.

* [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
* [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

## Building from Source

First make sure you have git and npm available as command-line utilities (so you should install Git and NodeJS if you don't have them already).

Open a command line interface in the directory that contains this README file, and use the following command to install DigiClicker's other dependencies locally:
```cmd
npm clean-install
```

Then finally, run the following command in the command line interface to start a browser running DigiClicker.
```cmd
npm start
```

Changes to the sourcecode will automatically cause the browser to refresh.
This means you don't need to compile TypeScript yourself. Gulp will do this for you :thumbsup:


## Use Google cloud shell _(alternative)_
[![Google Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.png)](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?git_repo=https://github.com/Listanon/Digiclicker)
```cmd
npm clean-install
npm start
```
Click the [Web Preview](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/using-web-preview) Button and select port `3001` from the displayed menu.
Cloud Shell opens the preview URL on its proxy service in a new browser window.

## Deploying a new version to Github Pages
Before deploying, check that the game compiles and starts up without errors. Then run:
```cmd
npm run website
```

After this command completes, push the changed files in the 'docs' directory to Github.
